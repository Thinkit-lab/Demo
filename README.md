# Assignment for Flutter Developers

Goal of the assignment is to:

 -> Show the capability of adjusting to the technical environment
 -> Demonstrate the will to develop and test high quality features/functionalities

 -> Test the candidate on project scaling field


# Assignment Task:

Create a Flutter project that demonstrates server-client communication, navigation flow and a certain form of State Management.
Install the Flutter environment on your computer, along with a visual code editor (preferably VS Code) and run this template application. 


The app contains 2 sections of tasks as follows:

# Home:

This section/screen you will need to demonstrate your skills related to network calls and local storage. 
1. Implement setup for network calls and local storage. You are free to use packages of your choice for both. Preferred: Dio, Chopper and Hive for local db.
2. Fetch the data from open apis for testing such as :  
   
       https://any-api.com/
       https://rapidapi.com
   
You are free to use any open source api of your choice.

# All Tasks and Complete Tasks

This section/screen you will need to demonstrate your skills related to state management.
Its a simple todo app where you will need to fetch data from firebase firestore and update the ui according to there completed status.
The user should be able to complete, read, update and delete the tasks i.e CRUD operations. 
The data should be update according in firebase firestore as well as reflect in the ui according as soon as one of the operations is done. Try to notify the user by showing some sort of message based on there operations.
